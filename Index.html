        <p>“The price of fame ain’t just in the riches, it’s in the choices you gotta make... and the people you lose.”</p>
        <!-- Jay let out a deep breath, rubbing a hand over his face. The weight of everything—his past, his success, the pressure—sat heavy on his shoulders. The liquor wasn’t helping, but it was the only thing dulling the noise for now.

His phone vibrated on the glass table. A single notification lit up the screen.

Unknown Number:
"Remember where you came from, because we haven’t forgotten."

Jay’s grip tightened around the bottle. His stomach twisted. The words weren’t a simple reminder—they were a warning.

The past wasn’t done with him yet. -->
